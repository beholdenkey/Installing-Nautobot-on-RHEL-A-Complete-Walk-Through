# Instructions

When Ansible is installed as a python package, none of the files such as the hosts or ansible.cfg are created. So you will need to make these files and then manually adjust your ansible.cfg file accordingly. For this process of implementing the STIG playbook, I have already modified the ansible.cfg file and the hosts file to local execute the ansible-playbook on the system.

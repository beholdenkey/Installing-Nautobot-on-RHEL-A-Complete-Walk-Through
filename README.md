## 1.1 Synopsis

This guide assists users in installing Nautobot on Red Hat Enterprise Linux. Although this installation guide focused on supporting organizations that require an increased standard of security, it can easily be forked and modified to support the needs of others. I will go through the process of installation, hardening, and STIG implementation. In addition, I will be using the ansible-playbook for the RHEL 8 STIG implementation. Please refer to the resources directory for the links to these repositories. Also, if you are not familiar with the dependencies of Nautobot, I highly recommend that you do some reading because nautobot consists of a rather diverse Application Stack.

## 1.2 Dependencies

### Mandatory dependencies

The following minimum versions are required for Nautobot to operate and the versions I have tested in production environments. I will not be using MySQL, so I will not be trying or going over that.

| Dependency | Role         | Minimum Version | Production Tested |
| ---------- | ------------ | --------------- | ----------------- |
| Python     | Application  | 3.6             | 3.9.7             |
| PostgreSQL | Database     | 9.6             | 14.1              |
| Redis      | Cache, Queue | 4.0             | 6.1               |

## 1.3 Server Requirements

Minimum VM Resource Requirements:
>Note: These are the minimum requirements these are not the recommended requirements for a production environment.

- vCores - 4
- Memory - 8 GiB
- Storage - 125 GiB

## Preparing Operating System

Before we do anything else, we will need to perform the initial configurations, such as selecting the necessary language. The following steps will be changes that may be depending on your organization's policies; however, the partition changes are a hard requirement.

First, we will go to the installation destination and perform the necessary partitions.

Step 1: Go down to "Storage Configuration," and select custom, and then click done.

Step 2: Click the "Click here to create them automatically" If you do click create them automatically, you will need to go back and reduce the partition size of the other partitions to give yourself enough space to create the new ones. (From here, you will add in the additional data and system partitions)

Step 3: Create the following partitions.(For now, I will not have the ratios available)

```txt
DATA

- /var/log
- /var/log/audit
- /var/tmp

SYSTEM

- /tmp
- /var
```

Step 4: Got to the KDUMP and click disable

Step 5: Configure you Network and Hostname

Step 6: Connect to your Red Hat CDN

Step 7: Make your software selection (I normally select "Minimal Install")

Step 8: Setup your root and User Account

### Update Operating System and install System Packages

```bash
sudo dnf -y update && \
    dnf -y install \
    git \
    python39 \
    python39-devel \
    python39-pip \
    redis \
    nginx \
    openldap-devel \
    nano \
```

>Note: nano is optional however I like to have it because not everyone is a vim master.

Ansible is a requirement to install the role and execute the playbook

```bash
sudo subscription-manager repos --enable ansible-2.9-for-rhel-8-x86_64-rpms
```

```bash
dnf -y install ansible
```

### Enable FIPS

```bash
fips-mode-setup --enable
```

Be sure to reboot after FIPS has been enabled. You will have to disable this again later

### Configure Firewall

```bash
firewall-cmd --permanent --add-port=443/tcp
firewall-cmd --permanent --add-port=80/tcp

firewall-cmd --reload
```

### Add SELinux Rule

SELinux may be preventing the reverse proxy connection. You may need to allow HTTP network connections with the command setsebool -P httpd_can_network_connect 1. For further information, view the SELinux troubleshooting guide.

```bash
setsebool -P httpd_can_network_connect 1
```

### Configure PostgreSQL Database

Install PostgreSQL-Server Module

```bash
dnf -y module install postgresql:13/server
```

Initialize the Database

```bash
postgresql-setup --initdb
```

Configure Authentication

RHEL configures PostgreSQL to use ident host-based authentication by default. Because Nautobot will need to authenticate using a username and password, we must update pg_hba.conf to support scram-256 password authentication.

As root, edit `/var/lib/pgsql/data/postgresql.conf` and make the following changes.

Before:

```bash
# - Authentication -

#authentication_timeout = 1min  # 1s-600s
#password_encryption = md5  # md5 or scram-sha-256
#db_user_namespace = off

# GSSAPI using Kerberos
#krb_server_keyfile = 'FILE:${sysconfdir}/krb5.keytab'
#krb_caseins_users = off

# - SSL -

#ssl = off
#ssl_ca_file = ''
#ssl_cert_file = 'server.crt'
#ssl_crl_file = ''
#ssl_key_file = 'server.key'
#ssl_ciphers = 'HIGH:MEDIUM:+3DES:!aNULL' # allowed SSL ciphers
#ssl_prefer_server_ciphers = on
#ssl_ecdh_curve = 'prime256v1'
#ssl_min_protocol_version = 'TLSv1.2'
#ssl_max_protocol_version = ''
#ssl_dh_params_file = ''
#ssl_passphrase_command = ''
#ssl_passphrase_command_supports_reload = off
```

After:

```bash
# - Authentication -

#authentication_timeout = 1min  # 1s-600s
password_encryption = scram-sha-256  # md5 or scram-sha-256
#db_user_namespace = off

# GSSAPI using Kerberos
#krb_server_keyfile = 'FILE:${sysconfdir}/krb5.keytab'
#krb_caseins_users = off

# - SSL -

#ssl = off
#ssl_ca_file = ''
#ssl_cert_file = 'server.crt'
#ssl_crl_file = ''
#ssl_key_file = 'server.key'
#ssl_ciphers = 'HIGH:MEDIUM:+3DES:!aNULL' # allowed SSL ciphers
#ssl_prefer_server_ciphers = on
#ssl_ecdh_curve = 'prime256v1'
#ssl_min_protocol_version = 'TLSv1.2'
#ssl_max_protocol_version = ''
#ssl_dh_params_file = ''
#ssl_passphrase_command = ''
#ssl_passphrase_command_supports_reload = off
```

>Note: All you are doing is uncomment `password_encryption` and setting it to `scram-256`.

As root, edit `/var/lib/pgsql/data/pg_hba.conf` and change `ident` to `scram-256` for the lines below.

Before:

```bash
# IPv4 local connections:
host    all             all             127.0.0.1/32            ident
# IPv6 local connections:
host    all             all             ::1/128                 ident
```

After:

```bash
# IPv4 local connections:
host    all             all             127.0.0.1/32            scram-256
# IPv6 local connections:
host    all             all             ::1/128                 scram-256
```

#### Start PostgreSQL

Start the service and enable it to run at system startup:

```bash
sudo systemctl enable --now postgresql
```

#### Create a Database

At a minimum, we need to create a database for Nautobot and assign it a username and password for authentication. This
is done with the following commands.

!!! danger
    **Do not use the password from the example.** Choose a strong, random password to ensure secure database
    authentication for your Nautobot installation.

```bash
sudo -u postgres psql
```

```bash
postgres=# CREATE DATABASE nautobot;
CREATE DATABASE
postgres=# CREATE USER nautobot WITH PASSWORD 'insecure_password';
CREATE ROLE
postgres=# GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE nautobot TO nautobot;
GRANT
postgres=# \q
```

>Note: This may seem obvious, but you do not need to follow these directions verbatim. You can change the name of the role and the database to suit your needs, but you must remember to insert those variables into the later `nautobot_config.py`.

#### Verify PostgreSQL Service Availability

You can verify that authentication works issuing the following command and providing the configured password. (Replace `localhost` with your database server if using a remote database.)

If successful, you will enter a `nautobot` prompt. Type `\conninfo` to confirm your connection, or type `\q` to exit.

```bash
$ psql --username nautobot --password --host localhost nautobot
Password for user nautobot:

nautobot=> \conninfo
You are connected to database "nautobot" as user "nautobot" on host "localhost" (address "127.0.0.1") at port "5432".
nautobot=> \q
```

## Setup Redis

```bash
sudo systemctl enable --now redis
```

```bash
redis-cli ping
```

>Note: You should receive a PONG.

### Install and Configure Nautobot

### Configure Nautobot Account and Environment

Create a system user account named nautobot. This user will own all of the Nautobot files, and the Nautobot web services will be configured to run under this account.
The following command also creates the /opt/nautobot directory and sets it as the home directory for the user.

```bash
sudo useradd --shell /bin/bash --create-home --home-dir /opt/nautobot nautobot
```

Create the venv.

```bash
sudo -u nautobot python3 -m venv /opt/nautobot
```

```bash
"export NAUTOBOT_ROOT=/opt/nautobot" | sudo tee -a ~nautobot/.bashrc
```

From here on out these you must perform actions as the nautobot user because the nautobot user is directly tied to the venv

```bash
sudo -iu
```

>Note: ``sudo -iu`` automatically places you in the home directory of the user.

### Install Nautobot

```bash
pip3 install --upgrade pip wheel
```

```bash
pip3 install nautobot
```

Confirm Nautobot Installation and Version
>Note: You should now have a fancy nautobot-server command in your environment. This will be your gateway to all things Nautobot! Run it to confirm the installed version of nautobot:

```python
nautobot-server --version
```

Step 5: Initialize your Configuration

Initialize a new configuration by running nautobot-server init. You may specify an alternate location and detailed instructions for this are covered in the documentation on Nautobot Configuration.

However, because we've set the NAUTOBOT_ROOT, this command will automatically create a new nautobot_config.py at the default location based on this at $NAUTOBOT_ROOT/nautobot_config.py:

```python
nautobot-server init
```

```bash
Configuration file created at '/opt/nautobot/nautobot_config.py'
```

Required Settings

Your nautobot_config.py provides sane defaults for all of the configuration settings. You will inevitably need to update the settings for your environment, most notably the DATABASES setting. If you do not wish to modify the config, by default, many of these configuration settings can also be specified by environment variables. Please see Required Settings for further details.

Edit $NAUTOBOT_ROOT/nautobot_config.py, and head over to the documentation on Required Settings to tweak your required settings. At a minimum, you'll need to update the following settings:

- ALLOWED_HOSTS: You must set this value. This can be set to ["*"] for a quick start, but this value is not suitable for production deployment.
    DATABASES: Database connection parameters. If you installed your database server on the same system as Nautobot, you'll need to update the USER and PASSWORD fields here. If you are using MySQL, you'll also need to update the ENGINE field, changing the default database driver suffix from django.db.backends.postgresql to django.db.backends.mysql.
    Redis settings: Redis configuration requires multiple settings including CACHEOPS_REDIS and RQ_QUEUES, if different from the defaults. If you installed Redis on the same system as Nautobot, you do not need to change these settings.

You can also create a template for you organizations Nautobot and that way you can just copy the file over to the server now and in the future.

Install Local Requirements:

```bash
pip3 install -r $NAUTOBOT_ROOT/local_requirements.txt
```

To add packages to you local_requirements.txt so that it can be installed and kept up to date:

```bash
echo <package> >> $NAUTOBOT_ROOT/local_requirements.txt
```

```bash
nautobot-server migrate
```

```bash
nautobot-server createsuperuser
```

```bash
nautobot-server collectstatic
```

Now you can verify functionality by starting it up in a development mode. This is absolutely not for production purposes. It is just to make sure that all of your changes are accepted.

```bash
nautobot-server check
```

```bash
nautobot-server runserver 0.0.0.0:8080 --insecure
```

You can login and verify account then exit web page and move onto the next steps.

## Deploying Nautobot Web Service and Workers

>As the nautobot server perform the following commands

```bash
cat > $NAUTOBOT_ROOT/uwsgi.ini <<EOF

#### Configure Systemd for new Services

Because we just added new service files, you'll need to reload the systemd daemon:

```bash
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
```

```bash
sudo systemctl enable --now nautobot nautobot-worker
```

Verify Services

```bash
systemctl status nautobot
```

```bash
systemctl status nautobot-worker
```

### Configure HTTP Server
 
>Note: This section may differ greatly depending on your organization. With that being said I am only going to cover self signed certificates

```bash
sudo openssl req -x509 -nodes -days 365 -newkey rsa:4096 \
  -keyout /etc/pki/tls/private/nautobot.key \
  -out /etc/pki/tls/certs/nautobot.crt
```

```bash
cat > /etc/nginx/conf.d/nautobot.conf <<EOF
server {
    listen 443 ssl http2 default_server;
    listen [::]:443 ssl http2 default_server;

    server_name _;

    ssl_certificate /etc/ssl/certs/nautobot.crt;
    ssl_certificate_key /etc/ssl/private/nautobot.key;

    client_max_body_size 25m;

    location /static/ {
        alias /opt/nautobot/static/;
    }

    # For subdirectory hosting, you'll want to toggle this (e.g. `/nautobot/`).
    # Don't forget to set `FORCE_SCRIPT_NAME` in your `nautobot_config.py` to match.
    # location /nautobot/ {
    location / {
        include uwsgi_params;
        uwsgi_pass  127.0.0.1:8001;
        uwsgi_param Host $host;
        uwsgi_param X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
        uwsgi_param X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
        uwsgi_param X-Forwarded-Proto $http_x_forwarded_proto;

        # If you want subdirectory hosting, uncomment this. The path must match
        # the path of this location block (e.g. `/nautobot`). For NGINX the path
        # MUST NOT end with a trailing "/".
        # uwsgi_param SCRIPT_NAME /nautobot;
    }

}

server {
    # Redirect HTTP traffic to HTTPS
    listen 80 default_server;
    listen [::]:80 default_server;
    server_name _;
    return 301 https://$host$request_uri;
}
EOF
```

```bash
sudo sed -i 's@ default_server@@' /etc/nginx/nginx.conf
```

```bash
systemctl enable --now nginx
```

```bash
systemctl status nginx
```

As the ``nautobot`` user perform the following

```bash
chmod 755 $NAUTOBOT_ROOT
```

Now you can attempt to access the Nautobot login page via the IP address you set for the operating system

## Closing Comments

There is still a lot of changes coming to this guide and a lot things to be tested. I decided to redo my documentation because a lot of it was getting difficult for even myself to read and understand. Please feel free to submit and issue if you see something that is wrong or something that could be better.

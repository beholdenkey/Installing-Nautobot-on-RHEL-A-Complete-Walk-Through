# Installing Nautobot on Red Hat Enterprise Linux - A Complete Walk Through

This is meant to assist users in installing Nautobot on Red Hat Enterprise Linux. I will go through the process of installation, hardening, and STIG implementation. This will be all done on a Virtual Machine. In addition, I will be using the ansible-playbook for the RHEL 8 STIG implementation. Please refer to the resources directory for the links to these repositories.

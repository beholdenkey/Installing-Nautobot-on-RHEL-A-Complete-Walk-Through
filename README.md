# Installing Nautobot on Red Hat Enterprise Linux - A Complete Walk Through

This is meant to assist users in installing Nautobot on Red Hat Enterprise Linux. I will go through the process of installation, hardening, and STIG implementation. This will be all done on a Virtual Machine. In addition, I will be using the ansible-playbook for the RHEL 8 STIG implementation. Please refer to the resources directory for the links to these repositories.

>Note: As of right now, this guide will not go through installing Nautobot in a disconnected environment.

Also, if you are not familiar with the dependencies of Nautobot, I highly recommend that you do some reading because nautobot consists of a rather diverse Application Stack.

Future Plans:

- Create Playbook with vars that support installation an configuration of either server installation and or container installation.
- Add Partition ratios for STIG preparation.

## Pre-requisites

Minimum VM Resource Requirements:
>Note: These are the minimum requirements these are not the recommended requirements for a production environment.

- vCores - 4
- Memory - 8 GiB
- Storage - 125 GiB

Nautobot has the following minimum version requirements for its dependencies:

- Python: 3.6
- PostgreSQL: 9.6
- Redis: 4.0

Dependency versions I have successfully used on production Nautobot Server:

- Python: 3.9.6
- PostgreSQL: 13.3-4
- Redis 5.2

>Note if you are not using the latest version of python and would like to install the latest version from source please go to the following link <https://github.com/beholdenkey/Installing-Nautobot-on-RHEL-A-Complete-Walk-Through/blob/main/Resources/python_install.sh> However you can also install latest python available for that OS through the following commands

```bash
dnf -y install \
    python39 \
    python39-devel \
    python39-pip
```

>Note: Keep in mind that we will be applying the RHEL 8 STIG and this will require additional resources for the increased storage requirements.

Step 1:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/beholdenkey/Installing-Nautobot-on-RHEL-A-Complete-Walk-Through.git
```

```bash
chmod +x setup.sh
```

```bash
./setup.sh
```

>Note: It is crucial that you review the setup.sh file before execution this is not one of those scripts that will do everything for you.

Step 2:

Create the database
>Note: This process will not go into setting up anything more than the bare minimum required database to support the Nautobot application. In the future I wil add documentation and instructions supporting my stream replication as well as load balancing support.

```bash
sudo -u postgres psql
```

>Note: These passwords are not secure and it is highly recommended that you set the password for the postgres role because if the password is not set there is essentially nothing stop someone from making changes if they are able to access the server.

```SQL
postgres=# CREATE DATABASE nautobot;
```

```SQL
postgres=# CREATE USER nautobot WITH PASSWORD 'insecure_password';
```

```SQL
postgres=# GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE nautobot TO nautobot;
```

```SQL
postgres=# \q
```

Verify the Service Status

You can verify that authentication works issuing the following command and providing the configured password. (Replace localhost with your database server if using a remote database.)

If successful, you will enter a nautobot prompt. Type \conninfo to confirm your connection, or type \q to exit.

>Now that you have exited you will need to go back in as the Nautobot Role and Connect to the Nautobot Database both of which you just created previously.

```SQL
psql --username nautobot --password --host localhost nautobot
```

```SQL
nautobot=> \conninfo
You are connected to database "nautobot" as user "nautobot" on host "localhost" (address "127.0.0.1") at port "5432".
```

By default these setting are sufficient because this database all need to be accessed locally by the Nautobot application.

Step 3:

```bash
systemctl enable --now redis
```

```bash
redis-cli ping
```

```redis
PONG
```

>Note: This is sufficient when it comes to configuring redis

Step 4: Create the Nautobot System User

Create a system user account named nautobot. This user will own all of the Nautobot files, and the Nautobot web services will be configured to run under this account.

The following command also creates the /opt/nautobot directory and sets it as the home directory for the user.

```bash
sudo useradd --system --shell /bin/bash --create-home --home-dir /opt/nautobot nautobot
```

Step 5: Setup Virtual Environment

A Python virtual environment or virtualenv is like a container for a set of Python packages. A virtualenv allows you to build environments suited to specific projects without interfering with system packages or other projects.

When installed per the documentation, Nautobot uses a virtual environment in production.

In the following steps, we will have you create the virtualenv within the NAUTOBOT_ROOT you chose in the previous step. This is the same we had you set as the home directory as the nautobot user.

>Note: Instead of deliberately requiring you to activate/deactivate the virtualenv, we are emphasizing on relying on the $PATH to access programs installed within it. We find this to be much more intuitive and natural when working with Nautobot in this way.

As root, we're going to create the virtualenv in our NAUTOBOT_ROOT as the nautobot user to populate the /opt/nautobot directory with a self-contained Python environment including a bin directory for scripts and a lib directory for Python libaries.

```bash
sudo -u nautobot python3 -m venv /opt/nautobot
```

Update the Nautobot .bashrc

```bash
echo "export NAUTOBOT_ROOT=/opt/nautobot" | sudo tee -a ~nautobot/.bashrc
```

>Note: It is critical to install Nautobot as the nautobot user so that we don't have to worry about fixing permissions later.

```bash
sudo -iu nautobot
```

>Note: Unless explicitly stated, all remaining steps requiring the use of pip3 or nautobot-server in this document should be performed as the nautobot user!

```python
pip3 install --upgrade pip wheel
```

```python
pip3 install nautobot
```

Confirm Nautobot Installation and Version
>Note: You should now have a fancy nautobot-server command in your environment. This will be your gateway to all things Nautobot! Run it to confirm the installed version of nautobot:

```python
nautobot-server --version
```

Step 5: Initialize your Configuration

Initialize a new configuration by running nautobot-server init. You may specify an alternate location and detailed instructions for this are covered in the documentation on Nautobot Configuration.

However, because we've set the NAUTOBOT_ROOT, this command will automatically create a new nautobot_config.py at the default location based on this at $NAUTOBOT_ROOT/nautobot_config.py:

```python
nautobot-server init
```

```bash
Configuration file created at '/opt/nautobot/nautobot_config.py'
```


Required Settings

Your nautobot_config.py provides sane defaults for all of the configuration settings. You will inevitably need to update the settings for your environment, most notably the DATABASES setting. If you do not wish to modify the config, by default, many of these configuration settings can also be specified by environment variables. Please see Required Settings for further details.

Edit $NAUTOBOT_ROOT/nautobot_config.py, and head over to the documentation on Required Settings to tweak your required settings. At a minimum, you'll need to update the following settings:

    ALLOWED_HOSTS: You must set this value. This can be set to ["*"] for a quick start, but this value is not suitable for production deployment.
    DATABASES: Database connection parameters. If you installed your database server on the same system as Nautobot, you'll need to update the USER and PASSWORD fields here. If you are using MySQL, you'll also need to update the ENGINE field, changing the default database driver suffix from django.db.backends.postgresql to django.db.backends.mysql.
    Redis settings: Redis configuration requires multiple settings including CACHEOPS_REDIS and RQ_QUEUES, if different from the defaults. If you installed Redis on the same system as Nautobot, you do not need to change these settings.

You can also create a template for you organizations Nautobot and that way you can just copy the file over to the server now and in the future.
